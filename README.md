### **Description for README.md**

#### CLI Calculator

The **CLI Calculator** is a command-line application supporting basic and advanced mathematical operations. It is implemented in multiple programming languages, including C++, Python, and Go, to demonstrate flexibility and functionality. This project is suitable for educational purposes, coding practice, and showcases clean, modular design principles.

---

#### **Features**
- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Functions**:  
  - Trigonometric functions (e.g., sine, cosine).  
  - Factorial computation.  
  - Support for multiple expressions in a single input.  
- **Custom Input Parser**: Parses and evaluates user-entered expressions.
- **Color-Coded Output**: Enhanced visibility for results and errors.
- **Cross-Language Implementations**: Implemented in C++, Python, and Go.

---

#### **How to Use**
1. **C++ Version**:
   - Build and run the program using the provided `Makefile`:
     ```bash
     make
     ./calculator
     ```
   - Enter mathematical expressions directly in the terminal, e.g.:
     ```
     Input: sin(30) + 5 * (2 - 1)
     Output: Result = 6
     ```

2. **Python Version**:
   - Run the Python script:
     ```bash
     python3 scripts/calculator.py
     ```

3. **Go Version**:
   - Build and run the Go implementation:
     ```bash
     go run scripts/calculator.go
     ```

---

#### **Project Structure**
- `src/`: Source code for the C++ implementation.
- `scripts/`: Implementations in other languages like Python and Go.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for all core features.
- `examples/`: Example input and output files for testing.
- `build/`: Generated files from the compilation process (excluded from Git).

---

#### **How to Contribute**
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests for:
- New features or improvements.
- Bug fixes.
- Additional implementations in other languages.
